"1","Mouse","Logitech LIGHTSPEED Wireless Gaming Mouse","Patrick Mullen","Reviewed in the United States on October 30, 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","The Logitech G305 Wireless Mouse is a solid option for those seeking a lightweight and easy-to-use mouse. It fits comfortably in my hand, though those with larger hands might find it on the smaller side. The mouse connects reliably with the USB sensor—I've had zero issues with connectivity.Setting up was a breeze with Logitech's G-Hub software, which made it easy to adjust settings to my preferences. As a bonus, the G-Hub instantly recognized my Logitech video camera, allowing me to manage settings for both devices seamlessly.The G305 offers impressive performance, especially for its price. It’s capable of doing more than I currently need, but that leaves room for it to adapt to various tasks as needed. I haven’t used it for too long yet, but so far, it’s been fantastic—highly recommend it for anyone in the market for a high-quality, budget-friendly wireless mouse.",5,NA
"2","Mouse","Logitech LIGHTSPEED Wireless Gaming Mouse","Chris C.","Reviewed in the United States on October 12, 2024","","The Logitech G305 LIGHTSPEED Wireless Gaming Mouse has quickly become my go-to for both gaming and everyday use. I was initially skeptical about wireless performance, but this mouse has completely blown me away with its 1ms report rate.One of my favorite aspects is the compact, lightweight design, it feels comfortable in my hand, and despite being lightweight, it’s durable and well-built. The battery life is phenomenal as well, with up to 250 hours of continuous gaming on a single AA battery, meaning I don’t have to worry about frequent charging or battery swaps.Overall, if you’re looking for a wireless gaming mouse that combines performance, precision, the Logitech G305 is an excellent choice. Highly recommend it for any gamer!",5,NA
"3","Mouse","Logitech LIGHTSPEED Wireless Gaming Mouse","Madilyn","Reviewed in the United States on November 9, 2024","Lightweight, reliable, easy setup. Great value for price, ideal for small hands. Highly recommend!","My old mouse died on me, the buttons stopped engaging and I couldn't keep up with my gaming.But this is just perfect!Three speed options, forward/backward buttons, usb-c port and wireless. It matches my headphones perfectly too! I'm not a professional gamer but this mouse is a really good starting point. It's simple and comfortably sits in your hand, left or right.I can't recommend this mouse enough!",5,NA
"4","Mouse","Logitech LIGHTSPEED Wireless Gaming Mouse","PandoRides","Reviewed in the United States on July 12, 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","I recently purchased the Logitech G305 LIGHTSPEED Wireless Gaming Mouse, and I have to say, it’s been a game-changer for me. As someone who games regularly, I was looking for a mouse that could deliver on performance without the hassle of wires, and the G305 does just that. I used to own one beforehand and lost it during a move sadly..First off, the wireless performance is outstanding. I haven’t noticed any lag whatsoever, which is crucial when you’re in the middle of intense gameplay. It’s really liberating to have that kind of responsiveness without being tethered to my desk.The design is another big plus. It fits my hand perfectly and feels comfortable even during long gaming sessions. The mouse is lightweight but feels solidly built, so it moves smoothly and doesn’t tire out my hand.The sensor is super accurate too. I play a lot of FPS games, and the HERO sensor handles everything I throw at it with precision. Customizing the DPI settings was easy using Logitech's software, and I’ve set it up exactly how I like it.Overall, the G305 offers amazing value for money. Considering its performance, build quality, and the freedom of wireless, I’d highly recommend it to any gamer looking to upgrade their setup. It’s definitely one of the best gaming mice I’ve owned.",5,NA
"5","Mouse","Logitech LIGHTSPEED Wireless Gaming Mouse","Mikel","Reviewed in the United States on November 22, 2024","","Wireless Performance: The Lightspeed wireless technology is fantastic. I’ve experienced zero lag or missed clicks during intense gaming sessions, and the 1ms response time feels just as good as a wired mouse.HERO Sensor: The 12,000 DPI HERO sensor is precise and responsive, making it perfect for FPS games like Valorant or Call of Duty. It tracks smoothly on most surfaces (though not glass) and offers excellent accuracy.Battery Life: The battery life is exceptional. With a single AA battery, I’ve gotten close to the advertised 250 hours of use. If you switch to a lithium battery, you can even reduce the mouse’s weight slightly while maintaining long-lasting performance.Compact Design: The small, lightweight design (89g) makes it portable and easy to carry around. It’s great for gaming on the go or as a replacement for a laptop trackpad.What Could Be Better:Size and Comfort: This mouse is on the smaller side, which might be uncomfortable for those with larger hands or who prefer palm grips. I found myself using a claw grip to get the best control, but it may not suit everyone’s ergonomics.AA Battery Requirement: While the battery life is great, I would have preferred a rechargeable option for convenience. Having to keep spare batteries around can be inconvenient in the long run.Limited Features: It lacks some advanced features like customizable weights or RGB lighting found in other gaming mice at this price point. Additionally, there’s no Bluetooth support, which would have made it more versatile for non-gaming use.",4,NA
"6","Mouse","Logitech LIGHTSPEED Wireless Gaming Mouse","Angelo","Reviewed in the United States on August 29, 2024","Lightweight, Fast, and Reliable Wireless Gaming Mouse","Been using it for a week already and is already the best mouse I had ever used, super responsive, clicks feel great and nothing beats the comfort of using a wireless mouse. full customization with the ghub app, I actually love that this mouse doesn't have rgb, I'm not a fan of having almost my whole set up light up when the lights are off in my room, except for my keyboard of course, I have to look at the key sometimes. So far the battery is still working, I do turn off the mouse when I'm not playing so the battery duration is probably going to be longer than 250 hours for me, which I also prefer the AA battery approach, you don't have to charge anything. overall, a really good experience and so far no delays or other problems that comes with gaming mouses nowadays.",5,NA

"9","Mouse","Logitech LIGHTSPEED Wireless Gaming Mouse","Alejandro Hernandez","Reviewed in Mexico on July 2, 2024","Really enjoying it!","I've been using the Logitech G305 LIGHTSPEED Wireless Gaming Mouse for 3 years now, and I’m absolutely thrilled with how well it has held up. This mouse has been my go-to for gaming and everyday use, and it hasn’t let me down once. The performance is stellar, with its Hero 12K Sensor and 12,000 DPI ensuring precise and responsive gameplay. The lightweight design and six programmable buttons make it incredibly versatile and comfortable.After 3 years of heavy use, the only issue I've encountered is that the spring in one of the buttons is slightly worn out—but honestly, that’s to be expected after such a long time. It’s a minor thing considering how perfect this mouse has been otherwise.For anyone looking for a reliable, high-performing wireless gaming mouse, the Logitech G305 LIGHTSPEED is beyond perfect!",5,NA

"12","Mouse","Razer Basilisk Customizable Ergonomic Gaming Mouse","Bryan Snow","Reviewed in the United States on November 14, 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","I've been using the Razer mouse for a few YEARS now(purchased 2022), and it's absolutely phenomenal. The precision of the sensor is unmatched, making it perfect for both gaming and simple web browsing. The hand feel is simply spot-on, fitting comfortably in my hand for hours on end without any strain, not to light and not too heavy. The customizable RGB lighting adds a nice touch, allowing me to personalize my battle station.What stands out most is the durability and build quality, where other mice start missing or double clicking my Razer mouse stands strong. The mouse feels solid and well-constructed, clearly built to last. Plus, the audibly responsive buttons and smooth glide are a dream for anyone who values quick, accurate movements.Obviously, the Razer mouse has exceeded my expectations in almost every way. If you're looking for a top-tier mouse that combines performance, comfort, and style, this is the one to get. Highly recommend!And besides, there aren't any batteries to change or charge! It really is my favorite mouse.",5,NA
"13","Mouse","Razer Basilisk Customizable Ergonomic Gaming Mouse","Bryan Snow","Reviewed in the United States on November 12, 2024","","Pros:- software support for razer software suite. Includes macros and every other function you would need.- sensitivity clutch is useful for shooters or as a modifier switch.- ""hyper shift"" the clutch mentioned above can be used to activate a secondary layer of controls. Holding it activates the layer and it's specific bindings, releasing returns to first layer of bindings. This effectively multiplies the usable buttons.- mouse wheel features tactile and speed modes, with additional behaviour customizations as well.- smooth gliding feet, no snags.- braided cable is extremely premium.- wired mouse for those who prefer it (like me)- plug and play . Functional and usable even should you choose not to install the software suite.- durable. I have purchased three basilisk line products from razer. My v2 lasted 2 years and was still perfect when I swapped to a v3. That v3 lasted a year and I just gifted it to my cousin. This one is my 3rd device and I have confidence in this brands durability.- 26k dpi max- supports ""stages"" of sensitivity that can be increased or decreased with two buttons behind mouse wheel. The stages dpi value can be altered using the recommended partner software suite from razer.- stylish design, appealing to the target audience.Cons:- sensitivity clutch is not removable. The v2 version has a clutch that works the same and CAN be removed. This product (v3) has the same but it CANNOT be removed. If this matters to you.Verdict:Many make fun of razer as being an edgelord brand and joke about it, but the truth is gimmicks and image aside every new product I've purchased from them has performed at or above expectations and was durable. This mouse is a great value for its functions when you are using razers connected software suite. However if you do not wish to use a software suite you may desire a mouse with more programmable buttons. This for me though is perfect. Clean because only necessary buttons, yet hyper shift allows me more when needed.",5,NA
"14","Mouse","Razer Basilisk Customizable Ergonomic Gaming Mouse","Brandon","Reviewed in the United States on November 14, 2024","Outstanding Performance and Comfort; Recommend!","This Razer mouse is an incredible value-for-money mouse. It gives you all the features of more professional gaming mice at a lower price. The optical switches are really durable, the ergonomic shape is really comfortable for me, as a righty. The scroll wheel modes are really useful, and the perfect amount of RGB is present. Overall, if you're looking for a high-quality gaming mouse while on a budget, this is a good fit.",5,NA

"17","Mouse","Razer Basilisk Customizable Ergonomic Gaming Mouse","Dilan Jiovanni Cano Equihua","Reviewed in Brazil on August 25, 2024","Amazing value.","IntroI recently picked up the Razer Basilisk V3, and I’m blown away. Even though I didn’t need a gaming mouse, this one stood out for its features and price, which beat the pricey Logitech MX Master lineup. It’s a fantastic value and has become my new favorite desk companion.OverviewThe Basilisk V3 is a joy to use. Its ergonomic design, customizable buttons, and satisfying scroll wheel make it a productivity powerhouse, even for non-gamers. And let’s talk about the RGB lighting—it’s completely unnecessary but so cool. Customizing it has been more fun than I expected!That said, there’s a slight learning curve with Razer’s Synapse software, but it’s worth investing the time. Once you tweak the settings, you unlock the full potential of this mouse, and it makes a real difference.Final ThoughtsMy only gripe? I wish it were a tad bit bigger—an “XL” or more productivity-focused version would be amazing. But for the price and features, this mouse is unbeatable. Whether you’re gaming or just working, the Basilisk V3 delivers serious bang for your buck. I'll be getting at least one more (to pair with other computers). Highly recommend!",5,NA

"22","Mouse","Micropack Vertical Multi-Device Bluetooth Adjustable","Grace Brandon","Reviewed in the United States on March 17, 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","Got this mouse in August of 2022, and finally retired it March 2024. The only reason it was retired was due to the wheel malfunctioning.I work from home (medical coding) and literally scroll patient charts ALL DAY. This mouse is so comfortable, quiet, reliable, everything I could have ever wanted. Given all the abuse I put the poor thing through, I'm so proud of it for not dying on me ages ago, especially with how cheap (price wise) they are. Can I give it more than 5 stars please?They look cheap, they are cheap in price, but they are NOT cheap in quality. It has survived drops, squishes, a stray soda being tipped over, my tantrums, and probably miles of scrolling.I replaced it with another one in a different color. Lol. I'll be back in probably another 19 months for another one. They really are the best. If you're on the fence about it, please take this as a sign to just get one. It won't let you down.Side note - they also match those typewriter keyboards that have the keys that pop off. Do what you will with this info. :)",5,NA

I liked the ergonomic feel of it and it looked like it was quality materials. Unfortunately it no longer works.  I contacted the seller and they were awesome.  They replaced my mouse and I'm up and running again.  This is an awesome mouse if you are looking for one to relieve the pain in your hand and wrist.  I really missed it when it stopped working.  I highly recommend this mouse.",5,NA
"24","Mouse","Micropack Vertical Multi-Device Bluetooth Adjustable","Gypsi","Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2023","Adore this mouse. It had a good life.","This mouse fits great in my hand -- I'm amazed at how comfortable it is.  I have less wrist stress after long sessions.  It works surprisingly well as a gaming mouse, too, with no noticeable lag.  Granted, I'm not an elite SHMUP gamer, but for my lower key hack-n-slash games, I've been quite pleased. The color matches the photo, which is a plus.  I can't testify to battery life yet, but will update if that seems to be a problem.  It was a simple, plug-n-play device, with no set up problems.When visiting, Mom tried it out and was impressed at how it felt, so I ordered her one, as well.  She's as satisfied as I am, though she doesn't use it for gaming that requires speed.I would recommend it for anyone looking for a comfortable mouse for long usage.

Also, stops for few secs while using, which is frustrating when my workload  is high.

"28","Mouse","Micropack Vertical Multi-Device Bluetooth Adjustable","ofmomentum","Reviewed in the United States on October 15, 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","i did not realize at the time of purchase that the mouse was battery powered, as in AA battery, not rechargeable, that in itself is not a deal breaker just inconvenient. But now even with a new set of batteries, it will only work for about 2 seconds before the light turns off and it becomes completely unusable. I got this mouse specifically for the extra buttons, which in the few moments the mouse is working, it fine. the mouse it self is rather large but the ergonomic angle is good for my hand and the side keys are in a position where they arnt easily hit by accident. Could be nice if the battery thing isn't a deal breaker for you but it just doesn't work anymore",5,NA
"29","Mouse","Micropack Vertical Multi-Device Bluetooth Adjustable","Kindle Customer","Reviewed in the United States on May 7, 2024","","The pink color is really cute! The click is quieter and softer-feeling than I expected and it took a couple days to get used to it; the scroll wheel is smooth. There is a large white glossy sticker under the mouse that is already peeling off after a few uses. The small panel cover was hard to remove (and will definitely chip your nail polish). But I plan on only using this mouse when I'm traveling for work, so this will suit those needs perfectly fine. If I can get a year or two's work out of this mouse, I'll be happy with that!",5,NA

Sleep mode on it is incredibly annoying- if you don't move it for 5-10 minutes, it'll turn itself off. Despite this, it seems to eat through batteries faster than any other mouse I've owned.
