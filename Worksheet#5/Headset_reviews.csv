"1","Headset","CORSAIR SURROUND Multiplatform Gaming Headset","Bri","Reviewed in the United States on August 18, 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","I love these! They're good quality, comfy, and they don't have that crazy LED-lights-blazing aesthetic that all ""gaming"" things seem to have.  I tested the audio while playing Minecraft since I already had it open: at first, I heard a bit of static when I turned the volume on high and was disappointed. But  then I used the usb adapter it came with instead of the aux (headphone jack) slot and it sounds very high quality with no static at all.Update: the mic works perfectly! Pretty average quality according to my friends when I asked, but nothing to complain about for regular gaming.Comfort-wise, these don't bother my head or ears at all. They're actually comfortable and completely cover my ears without pressing down on them or moving around a bunch. I don't have as big a head as my boyfriend though- he said he personally found them to be very uncomfortable (he's also used to his nice Cooler Master headphones)  Another thing I took note of was the texture of the ear muffs: very very soft on the part that touches your head, while the sides have a nice-feeling leather material.  When you extend the headphones for a wider fit, the inside part is made of metal which I like and they don't feel loose or woobly at all. These feel like they will last me a long time and I'm super happy with my purchase.Update: use these almost daily and they still look brand new!",5,NA
"2","Headset","CORSAIR SURROUND Multiplatform Gaming Headset","Bri","Reviewed in the United States on October 29, 2024","","For the price I do not think you could do better. Crisp clear sound and it improves when you install the icue software and add your plugins for sound drivers. Mine installed Nvidia and gigabyte plugins. Takes a few minutes to get it set up for your hearing. I am a bit hard of hearing due to my job. I now hear things in game I never could hear before. The ear muff's are very comfortable memory foam that do not put pressure on your ear at all true over the ear. I would say not the lightest set but not extremely heavy still very comfortable. Spatial sound is also compatible for Windows 10 and above users. Mic quality is really good and clear several noise cancelling options to adjust. Everyone on discord was really impressed with the clear mic once it was turned in. Once you get it set you will be impressed. I did experience some static one time performed a reboot and it never came back. This set does require a high power USB port if you use the provided dongle. I would recommend 3.0 USB port better. No lights or flashy things like other gaming headsets for the younger generation. This set does come with a voice synthesizer to download a few free ones and a few free sound effects to play with. I like the build quality so far they feel very well built.",5,NA
"3","Headset","CORSAIR SURROUND Multiplatform Gaming Headset","Kevin McDonald","Reviewed in the United States on November 24, 2020","Solid quality and good price!","While working from home, my Logitech on-ear headset was beginning to cause rashes on my ears from hours of continuous use.  To be fair, the maybe 2 hours of day they were used pre-pandemic when I was working in the office was fine.  However, the 8 to sometimes 12 hours a day was not working.  I wanted to find an over the ear headset but didn't want to invest too much into some of the game headsets.  I already have two Sennheiser gaming headsets which fill their role but are on the expensive side.The Corsair HS60 is a good set of headphones, especially if you can pick them up on an Amazon sale.  I have a relatively small head and the headset fits snug.  The top is padded but it can start to bug you if you are wearing the headset for many hours straight (and you have little to no hair for cushion).  You can adjust it so it's not resting on your head but then the headset will lean forwards or backwards which you will feel around your ears.  I've had extended days of working and have worn the headset for almost 10-11 hours in a day.  Not continuously, but total and have had very little discomfort.The sound quality is really good for the price (on sale).  No, it's not going to beat an expensive Sennheiser set, but it does not disappoint with sound quality.  I'm an avid music fan and have not been unhappy with the quality.  Keep in mind, this might vary depending on what you are using to drive the headphones.  If you have an elaborate Schiit system or something higher end, look at higher end headphones.  For normal computer and/or soundcard output, the headphones do really well and have a good range.The mic is another topic.  As you can see from the pictures, the mic is not a boom mic.  It is optional to use and plugs into the headset with a 3.5mm connector.  The headset does not echo your mic through the headset.  Also, these are a close back headset.  This means you can't really hear yourself taking and sometimes has you yelling into the mic to hear yourself through the close back headset.  The other thing is that the mic reads extremely quiet in Windows.  I did some searching through online forums and found this to be common.  Even with the mic cranked to the maximum in Windows, it still reads low when you talk.  The good thing is that I haven't had any complaints of co-workers not hearing me but it does make you feel like you need to speak louder.Since the mic isn't a boom mic, you can't just swing it out of the way.  You can bend it out of the way of your mouth (if you are eating or drinking) but you can't really get it out of your viewing area which may bug you.  Next, when you lay down the headset, since the mic isn't a boom mic it's a little awkward.  If you lay it forward, you have to bend the mic back.  If you lay it backwards, you will move the dial on the back for volume.  If you have a headset stand, then it doesn't matter.The volume dial, this is likely the weakest part of the headset.  The volume dial is extremely easy to accidently move.  The last complaint is the USB cord.  I believe it's got a nylon coating which means it's forever tangled.  I've had similar cords before on other devices and trying to untangle and keep them untangled typically does more damage than good to the cord.  I wonder if some of the reviews complaining about the cord breaking were trying to keep it untangled.Overall, for the money (on sale), it's a good product.  Don't expect $200+ headset quality for $50 (or whatever the current sale price).  I do think at $100, there are some other options out there but at $60 or less, these are good to have in your consideration.",5,NA
"4","Headset","CORSAIR SURROUND Multiplatform Gaming Headset","K. Pearson","Reviewed in the United States on October 5, 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","A while back I had a pair of Corsair headphones I think they were the s55, cause these are the s65's, however the pair I had broke in the worst way, the earphones on my old pair had plastic joints on the headband and they cracked right off üò≠. Could no longer put them on my head, sounded great and looked very similar to these but quality and durability was rather poor, these are perfect, they looked a lot like the old pair I had with a few minor differences, but when I looked closer and ran my fingers across the joints, turns out the joints are the same shape as my old ones, but looks like Corsair reinforced them with some metal, the joints you can tell are metal üëåüí™üëç cause they have a glossy texture, not like matt plastic, and they get colder when you let them sit like metal does, just seeing this little detail was like icing on the cake, not to metion for a chat mic, the clarity is unbelievable as are the phones, nice ballanced tone for listening to music and 7.1 virtual surround is wonderful for gaming, as it has an advantage to pick up on directional audio in video games very nicely. Pair it with Dolby Atmos and it's even better too. Highly recommend these headphones, I managed to pick up my pair on sale, for me worth every penny.",4,NA

"10","Headset","CORSAIR SURROUND Multiplatform Gaming Headset","PS_Ramos",NA,"5.0 out of 5 stars","Como podem ver √© um fone bem robusto e bem trabalhado, com costura na haste e nas earpads. Com microfone remov√≠vel de qualidade de capta√ß√£o muito boa por sinal.O fone √© Jack 3,5mm ou pode ser usado a partir da placa de som USB seja com surround virtual ativado ou n√£o atrav√©s do iCUE.Particularmente eu comprei para us√°-lo em stereo. E testei das duas formas, no 3,5 atrav√©z de um amplificador que uso no PC e atrav√©z da placa de som.Tanto no USB quando no Conector 3,5mm a qualidade √© excepcional, som cristalino, limpo e bem claro para localiza√ß√£o de som em jogos FPS (onde testei) e pra ouvir m√∫sica tamb√©m gostei do som das duas formas.Senti que o som tamb√©m direto na placa m√£e do PC atrav√©z de adapta√ß√£o pra 2 P2 soa bem por√©m tem bem menos volume e o som √© pouco menos encorpado que a conex√£o via USB pela placa de som. Usando via USB as m√∫sicas tem um brilho a mais, e o grave tem uma batida mais vida... Mas n√£o significa que n√£o d√™ pra usar com entrada P2 no PC, apenas soa melhor via USB.Quanto ao surround eu n√£o testei, n√£o me interessa essa tecnologia uma vez que pra jogos n√£o soa muito bem, j√° tive outros fones com esse efeito surround e sempre me senti confuso usando esse efeito.Quanto ao material do fone em si n√£o h√° o que se queixar. Haste em metal e conchas em um pl√°stico de qualidade com grades em metal, microfone em bom material e bem male√°vel.  Produto realmente muito bom, dentro da faixa de pre√ßo nunca vi parecido. Pra ele ser perfeito de tudo faltou s√≥ o cabo ser remov√≠vel tamb√©m.Pra finalizar, o tamanho √© bom e o conforto tamb√©m, mesmo eu n√£o tendo a cabe√ßa pequena, ficou muito bom devido as regulagens e n√£o senti press√£o nas orelhas depois de horas e uso. Isola bem o som ambiente, veda bem e n√£o deixa brechas. E sobre o som eu daria preferencia para usa-lo numa placa de som dedicada ou equalizaria ele no ICUE para usar no USB mesmo, pois o som dele cru via USB no PC soa desbalanceado, sinto que tem mais graves e agudos que m√©dios, e isso me incomodou... mas nada que n√£o possa ser personalizado.* Uma observa√ß√£o atualizando hoje no mes de agosto de 2024, tendo comprado o fone em out de 2023. Ou seja, 10 meses, e as almofadas soltaram o courino completamente, come√ßou a soltar partes ja por volta de 7 meses de uso.Por√©m entrando em contato com a corsair, eles me enviaram um novo par de almofadas novas.Achei que seria interessante esse feedback pra voc√™s. Porque tenham em vista que esse material de courino n√£o dura muito mas esse durou menos que costuma durar. Tive um Razer que soltou o couro s√≥ a partir de 2 anos. Por outro lado tambem ele √© um fone que te da garantia e voc√™ tem um bom suporte com p√≥s venda da corsair. E a qualidade geral dele, microfone, som, material √© excelente. Ja fiz testes com fones duas vezes mais caros que eu tinha inten√ß√£o de trocar por ele mas acabei mantendo e pelo visto √© dificil algum que me fa√ßa desapegar dele. Ele √© bem completo mesmo, e n√£o h√° o que reclamar fora esse pequeno detalhe no material das almofadas. Atualmente inclusive uso de tecido, comprada por fora e ficou excelente. N√£o perde qualidade de som, apesar de parecer que o som vai vazar devido ao material mas nao vaza.Meus agradecimentos ao pessoal da Amazon pela entrega super r√°pida e com a qualidade de sempre.",5,NA

"14","Headset","BENGOO G9000 Controller Cancelling Headphones","JUAN","Reviewed in the United States on October 5, 2024","üéÆ Immersive Sound and Comfortable Fit! üéÆ","I use these for call of duty and youtube some times my oculus 2. The rgb works with a smooth fade out loop although it's not addressable rgb it's pretty nice they even send adapters so it you want to power the rgb when your on xbox or ps5 it's independent from the controller power source (batteries) for pc you can just hook it up.Con the volume and mute switch on mine usually faces inward not a huge problem but sometimes moving around with raise or lower the volume a minor inconvenience if I would have designed it one would be on each side instead.Pros decent sound quality yesterday it saved me from being shot from behind in cod mw 2.0 the surround sound is decently crisp. The company is eager to please to to make sure you like it by the time I got it and started using it after a week they were checking up on how I liked it. After a couple messages back and forth he/she told me about the rgb being independent from the jack. Most of the rgb wired headphones I've seen aren't separated and only work on the pc. Now even watching TV (I have a projector) I can use the rgb. Microphone works as it should noise canceling I never hear complains from other players. The top fabric for comfort is comfortable I'm keeping the plastic they package it with to keep it clean. Each ear side get an addition inch approximately of length for people with bigger heads. The plastic ear cuffs are not going to flex unless to beat it with a heavy object the head band has just enough flex to it. And the microphone can be moved as it's flexible but also turned all the way pointing up . The head jack and usb splitter is pretty long about 6ft or so and it comes with a quality velcro cord piece to roll up for non use meaning if you wanted to you could put it on a headphone stand and hide the cords from you cat so it's not dangling.Suggestions to the company slightly thicker ear cups would be nice I got big ears so they kinda touch the inner fabric of the cuff and if I squeeze a little bit there's a little but of suction in my ears. Change the volume scrolling wheel to a sliding one and put it opposite of the microphone mute switch.Possible issues sometimes the microphone doesn't register on cod mw 2.0. However this is more likely to be call of duty chat program than the headphones because it happened multiple times with other headphones as well.",4,NA
"15","Headset","BENGOO G9000 Controller Cancelling Headphones","Tina Moxley","Reviewed in the United States on November 2, 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","This gaming headset is truly impressive! The sound quality it offers for the price is top-notch. Its accurate directional audio is a big plus for games that heavily rely on sound cues. It does the job of pulling you into the game world and helping you notice details such as footsteps or distant sounds that can give you an edge in gameplay.The one issue I've faced is with the USB connection for the headset lights. When I'm playing on my console with a controller, the USB plug dangles as there is no port to insert it into comfortably. It would be awesome if there were a battery-operated option for the lights to enhance flexibility. However, in general, this headset provides value and performance that any gamer will appreciate.",5,NA
"16","Headset","BENGOO G9000 Controller Cancelling Headphones","BasicBoringMom","Reviewed in the United States on October 29, 2024","","I use this with my Xbox Series X.It works as expected for the price. The mic picks up on background noise very easily. So when I‚Äôm playing COD with the fan on I have to manually switch on and off the mic when talking or else it would be a constant stream of background noise being broadcasted to the match/lobby. The volume isn‚Äôt majorly loud when up all the way. But, it is loud enough to hear what you need to.If you get this for an environment that is loud I would say don‚Äôt get it. Get a more expensive one that will have a better mic and higher maximum volume level.If you‚Äôre like me and just needed a basic mic to communicate, listen to music, and/or watch tv so it doesn‚Äôt go through the normal tv speakers then this is perfect imo.",5,NA

The adapter to connect to the computer aux and mic was defective, so my son used another adapter we had on hand.  After a day or 2, his head started to hurt from the tightness of the headset.  There is padding around the ears, but not enough, so there was pressure directly on the ear.We ended up returning it to try a different brand.Pros:  sound quality, mic, price, and cord length were good.Cons:  Defective adapter, tightness on head, cheaper quality (but reflective in price)",3,NA
