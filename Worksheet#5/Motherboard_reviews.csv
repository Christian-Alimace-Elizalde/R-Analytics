Runs Linux Mint 22 nicely, also very cool-no heating issues. I expect it will do as well with windows if you still use microsoft.  This is a nice board. I like it. I'm very happy with it.  This is the 4th computer I've built.  One for windows and then three after I moved up Linux.  This is the nicest board yet. I wonder what boards will lbe like when we all have to upgrade to 128 bit.",5,NA
"2","Motherboard","ASUS ROG Strix Gaming Motherboard","Misnad Haque","Reviewed in the United States on June 15, 2024","","Got this mobo at circa $180 and it was a pretty awesome deal especially since this model isn't available in Sri Lanka. The board is very stable, no issues whatsoever and provides excellent connectivity. The fact that it has Wifi 6 is even better. I like this antenna unlike the triangular one from the usual TUF series. The only issue though is that despite the ROG branding, it doesn't have a usb-c header for the front panel so be mindful of that. It also has a single ARGB header so if you need more devices to connect with Aura Sync, you'll need a hub. I loved the 2 M.2 heatsinks for the drives since my previous TUF board only had 1. The IO shield fixed as a single unit at the back is great and saved me a lot of pain (yes, fixing an IO shield is a nightmare on some cases!). One callout though is that the Wifi device was not recognized by Windows 11 via a fresh install so I had to connect it via Ethernet, update the drivers from the Asus site and then got it to work. Excellent all-round board to wrap up the AM4 line-up.",5,NA
"3","Motherboard","ASUS ROG Strix Gaming Motherboard","J.D. S","Reviewed in the United States on January 28, 2024","RUNS LINUX MINT VERY NICELY.","This is a really nice motherboard and was an upgrade over my older & much cheaper B450 that I, by a tragic mistake, dropped (literally) and accidentally broke. Visually, this ASUS motherboard I’ve replaced it with is stunning, much nicer than my last motherboard with larger & better looking heatsinks.For clarification, I bought the WiFi II version of this motherboard. Software-wise, well, I couldn’t get the WiFi or Bluetooth to work right away, but I found the required drivers included on a DVD. After inserting the DVD, there’s clearly marked drivers for the WiFi & Bluetooth. Unfortunately for me, the files didn’t seem to work in Windows 10 for Bluetooth, but it did for WiF, which was more important to me. Windows Troubleshooter couldn’t get the Bluetooth to work, and the drivers I tried from the ASUS website didn’t work either in getting Bluetooth to work. Anyway, it’s not worth returning over or going to great lengths to troubleshoot outside of the windows Bluetooth troubleshooter, as I had a cheap Bluetooth adapter I bought for $5 years ago, which I just plugged in and it worked right away. One of the first things I did also was disable the “armoury crate” auto-download in the BIOS. I thought that for a nearly $200 motherboard, it was strange there were even such bloatware options in the BIOS on top of included Bluetooth I couldn’t seem to get connected to anything. That was something I more expected out of a motherboard in the barely-over-$100 price range.It’s still a 5 (or maybe 4 1/2) star motherboard to me because despite the two little complaints I have about the motherboard, it still functions very well, handling a Ryzen 7 3800X with my H100i cooler quite well while also looking great. The RGB lighting on the motherboard looks great. WiFi works very fast with the included drivers on a DVD. (Although, in 2024, I’d like to maybe see drivers located on a cool USB) I had more fan headers on the motherboard than I had fans, which was nice.",5,NA
"4","Motherboard","ASUS ROG Strix Gaming Motherboard","Zr0Regrets","Reviewed in the United States on September 30, 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","This board replaced a dying X470 Asus Crosshair VII Hero motherboard. I would have liked to buy an X570 chipset board, but they are out of stock everywhere, overpriced, or used and as a personal rule a motherboard is the only part of a build I won't purchase used.With a 5950x the board out of the box with PBO enabled ran TDC-156, EDC-190, PPT-230. The VRMs were warm but not out of spec or concerning so this board can handle any AM4 CPU you throw at it. It can't match the raw power output of my Hero VII board but unless you have the ultimate golden sample 5950x with a custom loop you should be able to get the clock speeds you want without burning up the VRMs assuming you have solid airflow in your case.I run custom PBO settings that have been thoroughly tested on my old board, I put my old settings in the BIOS on this board and all benchmark scores were matched or slightly improved.One big benefit with going to a B550 chipset from X470 is now I can run my memory at 3600MHz without any stability issues. My old board didn't like anything faster than 3200MHz. Also jumping to PCIe 4.0 for M.2 and GPU is great to have. I moved a 2TB Samsung 980Pro from my old board to this one and while the raw speed difference isn't noticeable the latency is.I saw a lot of complaints about the onboard LAN controller and so far, I haven't had any connection drops or speed issues. I have multiple mapped network drives connected to my PC and move a large number of files back and forth daily and I haven't picked up any dropped packets while monitoring the connection. Asus and Intel just released a new driver in late September 2024 so maybe that resolved some of the issues, but I will update my review if any problems occur. The Wifi and Bluetooth seem fine with my light testing. I have the antenna on my desk in a large open room with a Unifi AP about 25ft and 1 wall away so signal is not an issue. I always use a hard-line connection over Wifi but it is nice to have anyway.As of now my only complaint is the onboard audio, it is a step down from my Hero VII, while they share the same codec, but the Hero VII had an ESS ES9023P chip, and this board it seems does not. I'm in the process of replacing my old external DAC so that issue with resolve itself.I got this board on sale and so far, am very happy with it. I will update my review if any issues pop up. For the price (on sale) it is very hard to beat.Good luck with your builds!",5,NA

"13","Motherboard","ASUS TUF Intel® 12th Motherboard Thunderbolt","Vitality","Reviewed in the United States on September 3, 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","Cut the cost in half buying through Amazon's Used option. Inside a generic brown box, it was carefully and safely packaged for shipping. It arrived in two days! The board works flawless with all of the features that I was looking for and expected at half of the price if buying it new. There are a lot of people that ship items back without ever even using them, and I highly recommend this option and this motherboard. If someone were to choose to buy this at it's current new price, this model is still a great choice. I'm just not sure for the full price that I personally would have went this route, because other models with the same options are available. It is a fantastic board, looks great with it's sleek all black military tough vibes going on. It has a very subtle RGB lighting effect on the top right corner. The setup is very simple and easy, but I've been putting computer builds together for over 25 years. Also my Lian Li Dynamic XL RGB case I've installed this board into is quite massive and would make almost any build super easy to assemble. So the ease of assembly really depends on not just skill but the case it is being installed in as well. This is a full sized board, and not a small mATX. My experience with the bios of this board and all of the features are as expected. I've definitely favored Asus for years now. This board has had no issues with my 13600k processor, or my two sticks of DDR5 6000 memory. I've easily enabled the xmp memory profile, and overclocking features to test and they all work as they should with my 13600k P-Cores hit an astonishing 5.7Ghz. After the test I've set the board back to it's default settings. Then adjusted the thermal limit and CPU voltage, setting limits, as well as making other various adjustments to ensure a very long lifespan. It is not required, but my preference. I very highly recommend this board, and am really glad that I chose to buy it used in good condition through Amazon. While I can definitely understand that this decision on such an important component for a computer seems like a very high risk, for me it was definitely worth it, costing me only half when comparing the price of new. Overall I'm left with no regrets and big savings on a high quality, top shelf, stellar product.",5,NA
"14","Motherboard","ASUS TUF Intel® 12th Motherboard Thunderbolt","Vitality","Reviewed in the United States on October 28, 2024","","After buying and returning another combo kit (from another manufacturer), this one worked perfectly.  I paired it with an i7-12700KF, 32 GB of Kingston Fury DDR5, and a somewhat old GTX 980.  ASUS has an option to overclock the board using their standard defaults, which gives another 15% in performance. Anyway, the board and rig is completely stable and fast.  A great setup for a great price.  Passmark says the computer is in the 91st percentile.There is a caveat, however.  Windows 11 installation media does not know about a lot of the hardware in this board.  So before you do the installation, go to the ASUS (and Intel) websites and download all the drivers you will need, especially including the Z790 chipset driver from Intel and the network drivers from ASUS.  Put them on a USB stick so you can get the hardware working after you install Windows.",5,NA
"15","Motherboard","ASUS TUF Intel® 12th Motherboard Thunderbolt","Hank","Reviewed in the United States on January 10, 2024","Absolutely Amazing!! HUGE deal when Buying Used","This is an excellent and very practical motherboard, suitable for both gaming and everyday tasks. While it may not have a PCIe 5.0 x4 slot for an M.2 SSD, it does have a PCIe 5.0 x16 slot for graphics cards and other expansion cards. Since it was released before WiFi 7, it still has WiFi 6E, but since WiFi 7 and PCIe 5.0 SSD's are both very recent with very few devices on the market that can actually use these technologies, these trade-offs have very little impact. The included heatsinks for 3 of the 4 M.2 SSD slots are excellent. I have yet to see my SSD's rise above 32 degrees Celsius, even when gaming. It would have been nice if this model came with a Thunderbolt 4 port on the rear I/O panel, but they have to make extra money somehow. The motherboard includes a Thunderbolt 4 header and an extra USB 2.0 port to allow for one of their Thunderbolt 4 expansion cards. At least using one of these expansion cards in the second PCIe 4.0 x16 slot doesn't affect the bandwidth of the other expansion slots, but using a Hyper M.2 expansion card in the PCIe 5.0 slot causes the first PCIe 4.0 x16 slot to drop to x8 bandwidth and the second slot to drop to x4 bandwidth. With 4 M.2 slots though, there really isn't a reason to use one of the Hyper M.2 cards unless you feel you absolutely need a PCIe 5.0 SSD. Similarly, there isn't really any need for a Thunderbolt 4 expansion unless you need a DP-capable USB-C port or USB data transfer speeds of 40Gbps. The rear I/O panel provides plenty of USB ports as it is, ranging from 5 Gbps USB Type A to 20 Gbps USB-C. With this motherboard, I use an i7-13700K CPU and Intel XMP RAM that can go up to the processor's maximum 5600 MHz. Thanks to ASUS Ai Suite III, I was able to set up a stable OC profile with the CPU running at an average of 4800 MHz reaching up to 5900 MHz on the P-cores, and with the memory frequency set to the advertised 5600 MHz. However, since Ai Suite III requires Memory Integrity to be disabled, I followed the advice of someone on a forum and re-enabled Memory Integrity after disabling Run at Startup for Ai Suite. Thanks to that advice, I now have ASUS' AI overclock working with Memory Integrity enabled. I have updated the BIOS regularly without issue, keeping my overclock settings by saving a BIOS profile .CAP file to a USB drive before updating. After the update, I just load the profile and everything goes back to how it was. The Q-Slot has made removing my GPU so much easier. This is important because the only M.2 slot that doesn't have a heatsink gets covered by the GPU when it's placed in the PCIe 5.0 slot or the first PCIe 4.0 x16 slot. I briefly tried placing one of my SSD's in that M.2 slot, but I ended up moving it to a different slot because, as expected, the SSD got much hotter underneath the GPU than in one of the slots covered by a heatsink. If you want to use that slot, I would recommend getting an effective low-profile SSD heatsink. The Q-LED's have been very helpful with troubleshooting issues at startup. For example, the GPU LED kept coming on during startup for some time. After trying a few things, I discovered that Windows kept forcing the CPU to use its onboard graphics during startup, even if I had the onboard graphics disabled in BIOS, which is why the splash screen that allows you to enter BIOS at startup as well as the Windows loading screen never appeared through my GPU output. Thankfully, my monitor has several input ports, so I was able to connect both the onboard graphics and the GPU to my monitor, set the GPU output as the main display, and now I no longer have this issue. This really is a great motherboard, and I would buy it again. I just hope they make an equivalent of this motherboard in the future with the new BTF layout that ASUS announced so when I need a new motherboard 8 years from now, I can get the same kind of practical gaming motherboard for the BTF PC that I will inevitably build.",5,NA

"20","Motherboard","ASUS TUF Intel® 12th Motherboard Thunderbolt","Ettereve","Reviewed in Saudi Arabia on August 24, 2024","","I installed this about 3 weeks ago and it was pretty smooth sailing. There are lots of plastic film covers on various parts to keep it from scratching during install/shipping. Remember to peel them off as you are installing.It has some LED lights that can be turned on or off in the BIOS. Speaking of BIOS, Asus motherboards always have nice, clear and easy to use BIOS software. This one is no different.One feature that I likes (but also hated) was that the screws in the M.2 SSD heatsinks were attached to the heatsink. It makes it easier for those with bigger hands to get the screw in place. In the other hand, it also made it difficult to line the screw up with the hole. I feel like there could be a happy medium there.Finding the Windows drivers was pretty simple, but on first boot, you are prompted to install the Asus Armoury Crate software. It let's you control/view the fan speeds, LED lights, see the temperatures, install latest drivers and more. It's actually a really slick idea, but the software itself is awful. It takes up a lot of memory and it crashes all the time. I suggest installing it to get the fastest drivers, then uninstall it right away. NOTE: You will need to use Asus' Armoury Crate Uninstaller tool available on their website to completely rid yourself of it.So far, I haven't had any issues with the motherboard itself. Hopefully it stays that way for a long time.",5,NA

Registré el producto en ASUS y tiene garantía hasta 2027, más que perfecto.Ya hace poca más de una semana que fue instalada y funciona de maravilla, tanto la placa como las conexiones de WiFi y Bluetooth.Estoy feliz con mi compra, ya que me urgía una computadora nueva. Si ocurre algo en un futuro actualizaré por este medio.",5,NA
