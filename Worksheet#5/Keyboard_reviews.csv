"3","Keyboard","RedThunder Wireless Rechargeable Mechanical Anti-Ghosting","AJ","Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2024","Perfect Birthday Gift (It was worth it)","The keyboard mouse combo was delivered sept 16 2024. There is a lot I like about this product. The keyboard feels good to type on, and the mouse has good performance. For basic use these are good items. I would say that if you are a gamer, the mouse had some intermittent issues with response. NOT for gamers.All of that could lead to a good review except for a few glaring problems.1. The battery life on the keyboard is not comparable to other products. It lasts a few days, which is good, but there are other similar products that get better life.2. The keyboard has had intermittent issues where it will just stop working. This is not battery related. The fix has been a combination of restarting the keyboard, reseating the USB, or at times restarting the computer altogether.3. The mouse is dead. Did not last even 2 months and nothing I have done has been able to fix it.While I will be contacting customer support I don't have much hope for a decent resolution. Average customer support sucks in this day and age. I will edit this review with that experience at a later date.As of now, I would not recommend or buy from redthunder again.--Update--Redthunder was initialy kind enough to reach out and offer full refund. Awesome... right?No.I accepted, to which they then sent a canned how to on fixing a keyboard. wait, sorry, one little piece about fixing a mouse that wont pair. As my mouse is dead and wont turn on (yes I know how to charge it), neither of these will work for me.Still no refund.Had they not reached out, or said ""sorry, past the return date"", I would have written this off. But I despise people/companies who promise one thing then dont fallow through. Or just ignore in this case.One star. Horrid customer service, bad business, worse product... Do no purchase.",1,NA

"6","Keyboard","RedThunder Wireless Rechargeable Mechanical Anti-Ghosting","Tina Lee Miller","Reviewed in the United States on August 23, 2024","The keyboard is GREAT!","Sent me a keyboard that was opened and very obviously used, slightly scuffed. I've been using almost 2 weeks seems to work just fine though, how much would another sticker cost? just to prove you made sure it works correctly? Only get one charger when you have two items that need to be charged.It was my own fault I didn't realize it doesn't use batteries. Charging cable is extremely cheap though, took 6 hour to charge so I could use it? Presumably why previous person returned? Thankfully I had my own charger and just plug it in overnight and haven't had any issues since, but then Ive only had it a short time. Mouse feels a little cheap as well and its made for mens/larger hands so its it a little uncomfy to use it. If you have the colors on, on the mouse it tends to lag alot while using not something that's desirable in a gaming mouse. But over all I like the board, However I am very glad I bought this on sale would NOT have been happy if I paid 60 dollars for this.",3,NA

"32","Keyboard","Logitech Programmable Backlighting Bluetooth Rechargeable","Vyctor Gregory","Reviewed in the United States on December 19, 2022","5.0 out of 5 stars","The MX keys is the best keyboard I've ever had. The keys are soft to the touch and quiet when they are pressed. As far as the feel, this keyboard is in between a regular desktop keyboard and a laptop keyboard. The buttons are sturdy and not wobbly. The backlight is perfect. A lot of reviewers complain about the back light not staying on, but It's best that it doesn't, because it conserves the battery life during each use, you don't even have to press any keys or buttons on the keyboard, the backlight comes on when your fingers hover over the surface of the keyboard. when your done typing the backlight stays on from 5 to 7 seconds, then shuts off. All you have to do is brush your fingers across the keyboard and the backlight is back on so you don't have to worry about pressing the wrong keys in the dark. PERFECT. If the backlight stayed on then everybody would be complaining that the battery doesn't last long enough. Logitech had this in mind when building this keyboard. Everybody is also complaining about the weight of the keyboard saying its too heavy, it is in fact heavier than the standard desktop keyboard, but that's good, because if its bumped it won't move or if it is placed on a slanted surface then the weight of the keyboard and the rubber feet will prevent the keyboard from sliding off of it's surface. My keyboard was sitting half way on the edge of my bed and half way off I sat down on my bed before I realized this. I was terrified and my hart sunk to the bottom of my stomach, because I thought it was going to fall on my hard wood floor and possibly get damaged, but because of the weight of the keyboard it didn't fall and I had a chance to move it so it wouldn't fall. The weight comes from the built in battery. I rather have a little extra weight, which isn't really a lot of weight. once you have the keyboard for a week or so you don't even really notice the weight. The weight of the keyboard is actually a BIG PLUS in my option. If your looking for a good keyboard with no latency as far as the response to the keys being pressed, then this is the keyboard. My keyboard is connected via Bluetooth and I've never had any connectivity issues. No need to worry about buying batteries I can just plug my phone charger into the Type-C connection on the keyboard and it charges right up, you can also use this keyboard while it's charging. Thank you Logitech.",5,NA

"39","Keyboard","Logitech Programmable Backlighting Bluetooth Rechargeable","Alex Whalen","Reviewed in Canada on May 26, 2022","","I ordered this because I want to be able to use my ipad as a ""laptop"" while travelling so I don't have to lug my laptop around with me, but I didn't want to get a new keyboard case because I like the case I have and I wanted to be able to adjust how close or far my ipad was to me so I didn't feel like I was hunched over it.  This works perfectly. The keyboard itself feels very sturdy and well made. The base itself is metal and the keys are plastic but seem to be decent quality. It is a little on the heavier side but it's not unmanageable and while I wish there was some kind of case or sleeve for it, I'll just use a spare bag to make sure it doesn't get too dirty or anything in my backpack.I'm really glad I spent the extra money on this versus getting a cheaper model. I've had bluetooth keyboards before that I didn't love because they were hard to type on or had horrible lag when I was working, and as a writer, that ends up being frustrating and almost useless. This connected with my ipad immediately and if there is any sort of lag, it's basically unnoticeable. Love that it's USB-C so I only need one charging cable. The pink colour is nice (not necessary, it would work just as well in any colour, but I think the pink is cute) and I found typing to be as easy and comfortable as typing on my laptop. Overall I'm very happy with this purchase and while I haven't had it long, I've had Logitech products before that are pretty long-lasting so I'm hoping this does too!",5,NA

"44","Keyboard","Rii Multiple Mechanical Multimedia Keyboard","Richard Faulkner","Reviewed in the United States on December 8, 2017","5.0 out of 5 stars","If not all keyboards are 'equal to' each other, this was definitely a 'greater than' all other backlit keyboards I have tried on my Linux system. To begin with, several of the others I have tried were designed specifically for Microsoft or Apple devices and any supporting features or ""drivers"" were only available on those systems. While most would retain the basic functionality of a keyboard, (i.e. you could type the characters on the keyboard into the software of your choice), some would not. My prior keyboard cost well over $40.00 on sale but the led feature was unavailable without enabling it deep in the system through a command line code using XSET. The keyboard would then light up but the numerical keypad was disabled...There are NO such problems with this keyboard in Linux. Just plug it in and begin using it after your computer boots. (I'm old school I guess, I always plug any input devices prior to booting so I can not attest to it being ""hot swappable"".)The keyboard looks great when lit and the characters are easily discernable while not being to large and ""garish"". The size of the illuminated letters on each key are aesthetically pleasing and in well lit situations does not require a backlight to determine the which character/key you are pressing but are still not quite as clear as a non-lit keyboard with printed characters in high contrast. This effect is the same for all backlit keyboards I have tried so far and appears to me to be the limitations of the current materials available for molding the plastic keycaps in a light dispersing plastic. The optional ""breathing"" effect is nice but I will seldom use this feature. The ""sleep"" function I have not yet discovered how to initiate on my system. The accompanying ""User Manual"" is sparse on any instructions with the exception of a small list of key combinations for using the FN + Function keys, (F1-F12), to control the multimedia functions of most operating systems and how to control the led keyboard itself.The light function of this keyboard is ""onboard"" eliminating the necessity of any extra operating system driver or software support.The keys have a nice tactile feel to them and are positioned well for extended use without discomfort. The board itself, while lightweight, has a substantial feel which leads to an impression of quality surpassing other keyboards I have tried which cost much more.If you are looking for a well built but inexpensive backlit keyboard, I feel that this is a very safe investment for almost anyone.There is one more caveat, I am not a gamer so I can not attest to how well this keyboard would function as such. However, if you are firing off a quick email to your mother, or beginning the next great American novel ...",5,NA

This thing is mechanical and is quiet, let me repeat that.... Quiet! So smooth and no special apps on your PC to make it light up. You can turn off the lights if you want at the press of a key. I'm literally going to buy a second one to replace my Razer keyboard.",5,NA

In my opinion, it is more attractive and a better RGB experience than other more expensive keyboards.  It's extremely soft and mushy keyed however and I don't use mechanical keyboards so I am used to softer keying and still seemed mushy.  That aspect was workable for me, though it might not be my favorite, but I can see where others would not like it that mushy.For me it has a tragic flaw that might not be a problem for others.  I'm a lefty and map the arrows and keys on the right side of the board for games for my right hand since I mouse left.  I also always map the num lock, which is in perfect index finger position.  This keyboard, unlike any keyboard I have ever used, does not register any keys if you have num lock pressed.  It seems to block other keypresses which messes up my gaming experience.  Again, dozens of keyboards over my lifetime, this is the first time I have ever experienced this.  My guess is they cut corners on the electronics to bring it in at this very cheap price.  But it is unusable in my case since I game often enough.  If you are a righty, or a lefty who does not game or use a keyboard for it, this might not be an issue for you.",5,NA

Not a great keyboard, but I didn't pay much for it. For casual gaming,  it works fine, however would not recommend it if you use it for work.",2,NA
