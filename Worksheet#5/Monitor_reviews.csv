"1","Monitor","Viewedge Professional Monitor Protection Adaptive","Amanda Moody","Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","The fact that you get the extra 1/4 of screen all the way around makes a huge difference. If you work from home and want a clean high quality screen I would highly recommend this monitor. I have a Samsung curved and an Acer all the same size in my three monitor set up and this Viewedge is actually my favorite of the three with great brightness and blue light settings. Very please with the purchase. It was easy to add to my 3 monitor stand set up and plug and play with the hdmi. Highly recommend.",5,NA

I will note that it does not have a lot of plug in options for screen sharing, I was able to make due with what I have.

"10","Monitor","Viewedge Professional Monitor Protection Adaptive","Neil O'Moore-Klopf",NA,"5.0 out of 5 stars","My original review is below this update(Revised review)After having written a review when this monitor failed the seller reached out to me to make good on the purchase and sent a replacement monitor that appears to be right off the bat, better and has none of the flaws the previous one had. For excellent customer service and for providing a replacement monitor free of charge in a timely manner when they had no obligation to do so, I am thoroughly pleased and happy to recommend this product being they have since stopped using the part that had caused the defect.(Old review)Monitor was perfect and had no complaints until I had it for a month when a dead spot appeared on the lower right corner, then that morphed into a dead horizontal line, then a few lines and moments before I wrote this review it started to flicker and ghost. It's not the computer or the HDMI cable as I tested multiple devices and had the same results on the monitor and I tried the same hdmi cable on another screen and it worked fine. Based off other reviews I appear to be the only person who had this issue. It is located in my custom cabinet shop but to my knowledge, no one had hit it with any objects and it hasn't fallen as the base is screwed down to the desktop. Maybe I simply got a lemon here but I figured I'd put this in a review for others to see.",5,NA
"11","Monitor","Viewedge Professional Monitor Protection Adaptive","Bryan",NA,"","Pictures are misleading - screen edge and bezel is much more substantial than in listed images, not thin at all (approx 1/4 inch). Screen is very blue-tinted; whites appear blue-grey-ish and dull. Power cord is quite short. Comes with a HDMI. As a monitor, it works, but not the highest quality - you get what you pay for.Amazon packing was very bad too - just two pieces of paper between the monitor box and outer box (no real padding, air bags, pellets, etc). Luckily the inner Monitor box was well packed.",3,NA
